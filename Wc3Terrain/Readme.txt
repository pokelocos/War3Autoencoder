Hi,
here are some instructions that are important:

- The heigh (and width) of the Targafile must be height (width) of the map +1.
  So if the map is 32x32 the Targa (.tga) must be 33x33.
- The Targa must be uncompressed.
- The Warcraft-Map must be a TFT map. (Maby it works with RoC too, I don't know)

For questions send me a pm at www.wc3sear.ch, nick: DarkLord.

.:Have Fun
